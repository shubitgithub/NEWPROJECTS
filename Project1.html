                    <h2>GOD OF CRICKET</h2>
                    <p><b>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar</b> pronounced born 24 April 1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian national team. Nicknamed "The Little Master"[4] and "Master Blaster"[5], he is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more than 18,000 runs and 15,000 total runs respectively.[7] He also holds the record for receiving the most man-of-the-match awards in international cricket.[8] Known for his large fanbase and described by ESPNcricinfo as 'the most worshipped player in the world'.[9]

                        Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[10] Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[11] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament.</p>
